#TASK 2
** Description:**
 This program implements a singly linked list, a dynamic data structure where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
 It supports three core operations: insertion (adding nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position),
                                    deletion (removing nodes from any position), and 
                                    traversal.
