**BATCH DURATION**:  December 30th, 2024 to January 30th, 2025


# TASK 1
**Description:**
 This program provides a practical demonstration of file operations in C Program. File handling is a fundamental concept in programming, enabling applications to store, retrieve, and manage persistent data.
 The program focuses on four key operations: creating, reading, writing, and appending data to a file.

# TASK 2
**Description:**
 This program implements a singly linked list, a dynamic data structure where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
 It supports three core operations: insertion (adding nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position),
                                    deletion (removing nodes from any position), and 
                                    traversal.

# TASK 3
**Description:**
The objective of this task is to create a simple lexical analyzer that scans a source code file and categorizes its components into distinct token types such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. This is a foundational step in compiler design, where the analyzer transforms raw code into a structured format for further processing.

# TASK 4
**Description:**
This program implements Run-Length Encoding (RLE) to compress and decompress text files by replacing repeated characters with their count, reducing file size. It supports both compression and decompression of text files.
